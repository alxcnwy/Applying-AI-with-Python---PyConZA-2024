 or some aspect of automating something that you do every single day, processing files, all that kind of stuff. Nowadays, you can take machine learning components and sort of plug those things together. Do cool stuff with them. So that's actually a really good example. So if you're interested in machine learning, the state of machine learning is such that a tutorial that takes an hour can get you to start using pre-trained models.
