 So do something super cool. And that's a good way to learn Python because you learn just enough to run this model. And that's like a sneaky way to get in there to figure out how to import stuff, how to write basic IO, how to run functions. I mean, I'm not sure if it's the best way to learn the basics in Python, but it could be nice to just fall in love first and then figure out the basics, right? Yeah, you can't expect to learn Python from a one-hour video.
