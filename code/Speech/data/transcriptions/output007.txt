 Way of coding. And I don't want to talk down to that kind of style of coding because it's kind of nicely efficient. But do you know where that is going? Code generation? No, seriously. GitHub Copilot. Yeah, Copilot. I use it every day. Really? Yeah, it writes a lot of code for me. And usually it's slightly wrong, but it still saves me typing. Because all I have to do is change one word in a line of text that otherwise it generates.
