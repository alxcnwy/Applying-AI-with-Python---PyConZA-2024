 Sometimes it sort of, if I name my function right, it writes a five or ten line function. And you know Python enough to very quickly then detect the issues. So it becomes a really good dance partner then. It doesn't save me a lot of thinking, but since I'm a poor typist, I'm very much appreciative of all the typing it does for me. Much better actually than the previous generation.
