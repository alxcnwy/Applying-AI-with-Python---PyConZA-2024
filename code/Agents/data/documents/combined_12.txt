Abstract:
HPy (https://hpyproject.org/) is a new API for extending Python with C, and is intended as an alternative to the existing C API. It is designed to have zero overhead on CPython while being much faster on alternate implementations such as GraalPy (https://www.graalvm.org/python/) and PyPy (https://pypy.org/) (donâ€™t worry, all of this will be explained in the talk).
Many Python tools still use  the C API, which harms their performance on GraalPy and PyPy. One such tool is Cython. Cython is a program that compiles Python code to C code for improved performance. The generated C files use the C API. We created an HPy backend for Cython, which replaces instances of the C API with the equivalent HPy code. This involved changing C API functions and structures to the equivalent ones in HPy, as well as reorganising the Cython source code to let it generate HPy-compliant code. We can create modules using HPy to handle data structures, function calls, and class creation with Cython.
After benchmarking our code on the C API and HPy on both CPython and GraalPy, we found that our HPy version of Cython can perform on GraalPy at speeds equivalent to the C API on CPython for some benchmarks, while on the other benchmarks our backend performed better than the C API on GraalPy, while still underperforming CPython. We also identified parts of HPy that need to be optimised further to ensure performance gains on all benchmarks.

Bio Part 2: I'm an MSc student at UCT in Cape Town, South Africa. My research focuses on creating a backend for Cython that uses the new HPy API to bind C code to Python, rather than the existing C API.
