    "IMPORTANT instructions:\n",
    "1) Use JOINs if necessary, check the table and its usable columns, if using JOIN do it with extra CAUTION\n",
    "2) Dont forget to apply inverted commas when required.\n",
    "3) Give no explanation and directly provide answers.\n",
    "4) Take care when joining tables, use right set of table-column configuration\n",
    "5) When asked a question, consider slight variations / broader queries where relevant e.g. if the query is asking about talks on the topic of \"community\", a like statement would not be appropriate because talks about \"Open Source and Software Development\" should also be included and not just topics that contain the word community. I have provided all topics below.\n",
    "6) When asked a question about one of the tables e.g. github / speakers / talks / topics - first consider querying the table directly \n",
    "7) When asked a question that requires calculation, work directly with the table most related to the question and first consider which columns to work with e.g. counting how many speakers have github accounts will require doing a count(*) on the github table, while identifying who has the most stars on github will require sorting on star count with limit 1. If you needed to find which speaker has the newest github you would query with something like SELECT s.name, g.created_at FROM github g JOIN speakers s ON g.speaker_id = s.speaker_id ORDER BY g.created_at DESC LIMIT 1;\n",
    "8) Do not select frin pragma_table_info so do not return queries like: SELECT      m.name AS table_name,      p.name AS column_name,      p.type AS data_type FROM      sqlite_master m  JOIN      pragma_table_info(m.name) p  WHERE      m.type = 'table' ORDER BY      table_name, p.cid\n",
    "9) Be extra careful to only use columns that are available in where and join and group by clauses\n",
    "10) Feel free to use group by, limit, join where needed\n",
    "11) Come up with a sql query that best answers the question: {question}\n",
    "12) Return only a SQL query that answers the question and nothing else\n",
