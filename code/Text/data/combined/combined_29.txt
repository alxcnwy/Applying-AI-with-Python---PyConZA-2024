Abstract:
The adoption of
Open Source Software
(OSS) in education has the potential to revolutionise learning environments, especially in resource-constrained regions. This talk delves into how schools can leverage OSS to overcome educational barriers, reduce costs, and foster a culture of innovation and collaboration.
I will begin by examining the current state of OSS adoption in schools, highlighting successful case studies where OSS has significantly impacted the quality of education. Through these examples, I will explore how OSS provides accessible, customisable, and cost-effective solutions that can be tailored to meet diverse educational needs.
Next, I will address the practical challenges schools face in implementing OSS, including issues related to infrastructure, training, and resistance to change. By sharing insights and strategies from educators and tech enthusiasts who have successfully navigated these challenges, I will aim to provide actionable steps for wider OSS adoption.
Finally, I will discuss the broader implications of integrating OSS into the educational system. This includes promoting digital literacy, encouraging problem-solving and critical thinking skills, and preparing students for a future in which open-source technologies play a crucial role.
