Abstract:
In his seminal ‚ÄúNoonday Demon: An Atlas of Depression‚Äù, Andrew Solomon remarked that there is an entire world of silent ‚Äúagonizing lives in invisible wheelchairs, dressed in invisible bodycasts".
It is becoming increasingly apparent that the tech sector is no exception. In the recent ‚ÄúMental Health in Tech Survey" (https://osmihelp.org/research.html) only 30.7% of respondents indicated that they ‚Äúfeel comfortable discussing mental health with coworkers‚Äù. This seems unsurprising, given that when mental health was discussed only 33.6% of respondents ‚Äúexperienced or observed a supportive or well-handled response‚Äù.
As someone with a history of mental illness myself, I spent the last year conducting interviews with individuals struggling with mental health in the tech sector. In addition, I also interviewed legal and therapeutic practitioners to create a list of avenues of support you are legally entitled to as a South African citizen. In this talk, I hope to share some insights uncovered during this personal investigation.
