offers across the whole time series forecasting pipeline: preprocessing and anomaly detection, modelling (including ensembling), and performance evaluation and backtesting. We will start with an overview of the basic classes and components of
Darts
, followed by a demonstration of how to implement a basic ensemble model and visualise forecast results.
Additionally, we will also discuss some key features of Darts that sets it apart from more traditional time series libraries. In particular, the ‘Pythonic’ structuring of its models to use the
fit()
and
predict()
methods we’ve all come to know and love, similar to the popular Python
scikit-learn
library. We will also discuss some other advantages, such as the ease of including static past and future covariates, and encoders, as well as its integration with other popular Python libraries like
pandas
. As it’s a relatively new library, we will also discuss some of its current shortcomings.

7,Mental Illness and Vulnerability in Tech,"In his seminal “Noonday Demon: An Atlas of Depression”, Andrew Solomon remarked that there is an entire world of silent “agonizing lives in invisible wheelchairs, dressed in invisible bodycasts"".
It is becoming increasingly apparent that the tech sector is no exception. In the recent “Mental Health in Tech Survey"" (https://osmihelp.org/research.html) only 30.7% of respondents indicated that they “feel comfortable discussing mental health with coworkers”. This seems unsurprising, given that when mental health was discussed only 33.6% of respondents “experienced or observed a supportive or well-handled response”.
As someone with a history of mental illness myself, I spent the last year conducting interviews with individuals struggling with mental health in the tech sector. In addition, I also interviewed legal and therapeutic practitioners to create a list of avenues of support you are legally entitled to as a South African citizen. In this talk, I hope to share some insights uncovered during this personal investigation.",Schalk Venter,https://2024.za.pycon.org/users/schalkventer/,https://2024.za.pycon.org/talks/27-mental-illness-and-vulnerability-in-tech/,6
8,Bridging Language Barriers: Making Programming Education Accessible to All,"In a diverse and multilingual country like South Africa, the transformative power of programming should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their native language. In a post-COVID world, where digital uptake and transformation have accelerated, the Centre for High-Performance Computing (CHPC) is spearheading an initiative to make programming education more inclusive. By translating our summer school training materials covering Python, High-Performance Computing (HPC) concepts, and Research Software Engineering applications into various native languages, we aim to break down language barriers and enable non-native English speakers to engage with emerging technologies.
The hybrid format of the CHPC summer school training has enabled access for over 700 postgraduate students and researchers from South African universities and scientific institutions each year, with this number continuing to grow. Combining both in-person and online sessions allows students from all regions, including those in remote or underserved areas, to participate fully. By offering training materials in multiple languages, we package the content in a way that resonates with all South Africans, enabling them to own programming and engage with it in their mother tongue. This inclusive approach aims to make programming and technology education available and enjoyable for everyone.
This talk will delve into the technical and cultural challenges of translating programming languages, explore the methodologies we have adopted, and highlight the impact of this project on local communities.

11,Building a Decisioning Engine for Data Scientists: A Practical Guide,"Machine learning offers a modern replacement for
human-curated predictive decisioning
. However, in practice,
predictive rules
manually created from
expert domain knowledge
remain extremely relevant in many industries, most notably
finance
. These rules are straightforward, highly explainable, and enable experts to incorporate valuable domain knowledge. However, the
open-source ecosystem
until recently, lacked comprehensive tooling for creating
decision flows
that can be
operationalized
following modern-day
machine learning
best practices.
In this talk, we will introduce a new
open-source decisioning framework
built on
Hamilton
, a versatile framework designed to streamline the creation and management of
dataflows
using standard Python functions. Hamilton simplifies the development process by converting functions into nodes in a
Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
, allowing for efficient execution and
visualization
of decision flows. Our new open-sourced framework enables scientists to create rules around
Statistical
,
Machine Learning
, and
Large-language models
. We will showcase the framework's ability to address
fraud detection
,
credit granting
, and integration with
LLMs
. This session is tailored for
decision creators
(e.g.,
data scientists
,
decision scientists
, and
data analysts
), and
operations engineers
.
The talk will delve into the key components of our Python-based decisioning solution applicable to finance, including
decision trees
,
credit risk scorecards
, and
decision tables
. We will emphasize using
Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)
to achieve
interoperability
,
traceability
, and
visual insights
into decision-making processes. We will then show how these decisioning processes can be
productionised
for
real-time
and
batch
use cases. The talk will provide listeners with practical insights for developing decisioning flows using best practices.",Sholto Armstrong,https://2024.za.pycon.org/users/sjnarmstrong/,https://2024.za.pycon.org/talks/37-building-a-decisioning-engine-for-data-scientists-a-practical-guide/,10
12,Implementing an HPy Backend for Cython,"HPy (https://hpyproject.org/) is a new API for extending Python with C, and is intended as an alternative to the existing C API. It is designed to have zero overhead on CPython while being much faster on alternate implementations such as GraalPy (https://www.graalvm.org/python/) and PyPy (https://pypy.org/) (don’t worry, all of this will be explained in the talk).
Many Python tools still use  the C API, which harms their performance on GraalPy and PyPy. One such tool is Cython. Cython is a program that compiles Python code to C code for improved performance. The generated C files use the C API. We created an HPy backend for Cython, which replaces instances of the C API with the equivalent HPy code. This involved changing C API functions and structures to the equivalent ones in HPy, as well as reorganising the Cython source code to let it generate HPy-compliant code. We can create modules using HPy to handle data structures, function calls, and class creation with Cython.
After benchmarking our code on the C API and HPy on both CPython and GraalPy, we found that our HPy version of Cython can perform on GraalPy at speeds equivalent to the C API on CPython for some benchmarks, while on the other benchmarks our backend performed better than the C API on GraalPy, while still underperforming CPython. We also identified parts of HPy that need to be optimised further to ensure performance gains on all benchmarks.",Du Toit Spies,https://2024.za.pycon.org/users/DuToitSpies/,https://2024.za.pycon.org/talks/38-implementing-an-hpy-backend-for-cython/,11
13,Streamlining HPC Operations: Integrating Django Helpdesk in Resource-Constrained Environments,"Django helpdesk is a general purpose ticketing system that can be used in a variety of applications. This talk examines the deployment of Django Helpdesk as a crucial component of the software stack used for large-scale HPC system deployments in resource-constrained environments. The HPC Ecosystems Project, spearheaded by the Centre for High Performance Computing (CHPC) is dedicated to deploying HPC cyber-infrastructure to SKA partner sites across Africa and providing comprehensive HPC System Administrator training throughout the continent.
Over the past decade, this project has successfully deployed 35 HPC systems across Africa. The latest iteration of the software stack has focused on using a blackbox approach to deployment utilizing OpenHPC. To complement this, a similar approach is being adopted for the user support interface, incorporating ticketing and helpdesk functionalities. Django Helpdesk was chosen for this role, representing a pivotal step in refining our deployment strategy to enhance helpdesk operations and user support.
Django Helpdesk is a powerful web-based ticketing system that offers several advantages for HPC environments. This talk will explore the key benefits of Django Helpdesk, including its flexibility, user-friendly interface, and robust capabilities. By comparing it with other ticketing tools commonly used in HPC settings, we will highlight its strengths and limitations. The discussion will provide insights into the deployment process and demonstrate how Django Helpdesk can be effectively utilized to improve support workflows and user interactions. Attendees will leave with practical knowledge on deploying Django Helpdesk in general and a deeper understanding of its critical role in advancing user support strategies. The application of Django Helpdesk is by no means specific to HPC and therefore attendees might find this ticketing system for their own needs.",Binjamin Barsch,https://2024.za.pycon.org/users/bbarsch/,https://2024.za.pycon.org/talks/39-streamlining-hpc-operations-integrating-django-helpdesk-in-resource-constrained-environments/,12
14,"You don't need a data service, you just need an object store and some JSON files","What are you talking about?
In this talk, I will describe an approach to building highly scalable services that is both extremely reliable and dirt cheap to run. The essence of our approach is eschewing popular service frameworks such as Flask, and instead sweating the HTTP API of object stores, such as those made available by large cloud providers, or on-premise options such as Minio or Ceph, along with supporting infrastructure such as data pipelines and content delivery networks.
To illustrate this concept, I'll talk through the architecture of the City's open source
Service Alert API
, and how we provide a near real time data API which is well specified using an OpenAPI spec, but is really just a few JSON files in AWS's S3.
Who is this for?
This should be interesting to anyone that is nervous about having to support a large user base, but has important information that they need to make available. For small teams or those lacking DevOps capacity, we believe this is an extremely viable approach. It's also potentially a cautionary tale about what happens when the hubris of Man is left unchecked.",Gordon Inggs,https://2024.za.pycon.org/users/gordon.inggs@capetown.gov.za/,https://2024.za.pycon.org/talks/40-you-dont-need-a-data-service-you-just-need-an-object-store-and-some-json-files/,13
15,Great Expectations About Data Quality,"A story about the City of Cape Town Data Science Branch’s quest to develop a framework for measuring and monitoring data quality; what worked, what didn’t, and what we learnt along the way.
Testing out popular data quality packages from the Python ecosystem (Great Expectations, Soda) and a roll-your-own approach, we contended with both generic and domain-specific measures of data quality.
I'll begin the talk with a brief background to the Data Science Branch and provide some context for why we embarked on the data quality mission. I'll then present an introduction to the study of data quality, before moving on to our implementation in Python using the packages described above, discussing the pros and cons of each approach. I'll wrap up the talk by discussing our future plans and summarizing the major learnings we gained along the way.
This talk is intended for anyone who has faced questions about data quality in their own work, and emerged more or less unscathed. It is hoped that the presentation provides insight to both the audience and speaker by generating discussion about other data practitioners’ experiences in this realm.",Ariella Rink,https://2024.za.pycon.org/users/AriellaRink/,https://2024.za.pycon.org/talks/41-great-expectations-about-data-quality/,14
16,Made you look: Using Siamese Neural Networks for Building Change Detection at the City of Cape Town,"What is this talk about?
One of the most important processes undertaken by a Municipal Government in South Africa is keeping cadastral information (property) up to date. This is an important dataset not only for planning the work of the municipality, such as the ongoing provision of water and electricity, but also has important implications for property rates, the taxes that local government levies to provide basic services.
For several years, the City of Cape Town has been using a digital surface modelling (DSM) approach to detect significant changes in property height, and then through manual review, identifying meaningful changes to properties. In collaboration with the Data Science branch, the City's Valuations Department has taken things to the next level by employing deep learning to automatically identify property changes of interest.
In this talk, we will describe this work, both from a technical perspective, as well as how we have applied the model developed to realise value in a complex operating environment.
Who is this talk for?
Anyone interested in remote sensing, deep learning and the practical applications thereof. The talk will also be of interest to anyone curious in the application of (relatively) advanced data science in local government.",Jolanda Becker,https://2024.za.pycon.org/users/jolanda/,https://2024.za.pycon.org/talks/42-made-you-look-using-siamese-neural-networks-for-building-change-detection-at-the-city-of-cape-town/,15

18,Power to the people who teach the people to code,"Teaching people to code is...tricky.
Software development and teaching are two distinct skill sets, yet people with technical skills are often put into a position where they are meant to teach others, this might be through workplace mentorship, community involvement, or through being hired to teach (for example, in a bootcamp). They are often expected to succeed with very little or no teacher training at all. A lot of common practice is very ineffective.
Many think that when it comes to teaching, you either have it or you don't. I'm happy to inform you that those people are mistaken.
Teaching and learning is something that has been well studied. There are techniques, patterns, and anti-patterns. There are skills that can be learned and practiced.
I've been working in alternative education for a number of years, and the people who graduate from the courses I've put together tend to do really well for themselves.
In this talk, I'd like to share a few of the things I've learned over the years. We'll cover studies, mindsets, mechanisms, patterns, and anti-patterns.  The Python community is full of people with teacher's hearts. My goal is to amplify their efforts.",Sheena O'Connell,https://2024.za.pycon.org/users/sheena/,https://2024.za.pycon.org/talks/46-power-to-the-people-who-teach-the-people-to-code/,17

24,Accelerate your pandas workload using FireDucks at zero manual effort,"In general, a Data Scientist spends significant efforts in transforming the raw data into a more digestible format before training an AI model or creating visualizations. Traditional tools such as pandas have long been the linchpin in this process, offering powerful capabilities but not without limitations. With numerous possible ways to write the same thing in pandas, often a user ends up selecting the uneconomical, inefficient ones, leading to large computational costs with the growth in data size. We introduce a couple of frequently occurring intricate performance issues in pandas, along with a compiler-accelerated high-performance library named FireDucks to auto-detect and optimize those issues without any manual effort. We will also demonstrate how FireDucks can outperform the existing high-performance pandas alternatives.
The growth of data sizes and the increase in performance cost create the demand for high-performance DataFrame libraries. However, the existing pandas alternatives often compel a 
user to learn completely new APIs (incurring migration cost), whereas some of the others 
demand a more efficient computational system (incurring hardware cost). To address the 
same, we at NEC R&D Lab Japan, have developed
FireDucks
, a solution that’s been crafted for the contemporary data professional who loves flexible user APIs in pandas and wants to enhance the performance of their application without any extra hardware cost when dealing with voluminous and complex data on a regular basis. It is released on pypi.org under the 3-Clause BSD License and can be simply installed using pip.
Here is the outline of the talk:
Current challenges of large-scale data analysis using pandas and other libraries. (5 mins)
Introduction to FireDucks (developed at NEC R&D Lab) and its offerings. (10 mins)
Demo on automatic acceleration of pandas workload using FireDucks. (5 mins)
Tricks and Tips on writing better code related to large-scale data analysis. (5 mins)
Performance comparison of FireDucks and other data analysis Python libraries. (5 mins)
The key takeaways from the session would be as follows:
How the choice and execution order of API calls in writing an application (not limited to pandas) impacts its performance.
How compiler technologies can be useful to auto-detect and optimize existing performance issues in a pandas-like application, enabling a user to write efficient code.
How FireDucks can help to focus more on in-depth data analysis instead of spending hours optimizing an existing code at the production level.
Target Audience:
Whoever uses pandas or related libraries for large-data analysis shall find this session useful.",Sourav Saha,https://2024.za.pycon.org/users/qsourav/,https://2024.za.pycon.org/talks/25-accelerate-your-pandas-workload-using-fireducks-at-zero-manual-effort/,23
25,Sensor data processing on microcontrollers with MicroPython,"Being able to measure physical phenomena is critical to many areas of science and engineering;
from measuring pollution in public spaces to monitoring of critical infrastructure. Over the last decades, the capabilities and costs of sensor system has become much better, driven by improvements in microprocessors, MEMS sensor technology, and low-energy wireless communication. Thanks to this Wireless Sensor Networks and ""Internet of Things"" (IoT) sensor systems are becoming common.
Typical sensor nodes use microcontroller-based hardware, and the firmware developed primarily using C (or C++). However, it is now becoming feasible to write microcontroller firmware using Python. This is thanks to the MicroPython project, combined with affordable and powerful hardware from the last couple of years. Using the familiar and high-level Python programming language makes the process of creating sensor nodes more accessible to an engineer or scientist.
In this talk we will discuss developing microcontroller-based sensors using MicroPython. This includes a brief introduction to MicroPython, how to do efficient data processing, and share our experience applying this to process accelerometer and microphone data, using both Digital Signal Processing and Machine Learning techniques.
We will apply some functionality, techniques, and lessons learned from the emlearn-micropython project - a Machine Learning and Digital Signal Processing library for MicroPython. Code available at: https://github.com/emlearn/emlearn-micropython
Intended audience: Any developer or data scientist curious about sensor data processing, IoT,
and how Python scales down to the smallest of devices.",Jon Nordby,https://2024.za.pycon.org/users/jonnor/,https://2024.za.pycon.org/talks/31-sensor-data-processing-on-microcontrollers-with-micropython/,24

If you’ve ever wanted to turn your coding skills into revenue-generating side-projects, I hope this talk both inspires and helps you to get started.",Cory Zue,https://2024.za.pycon.org/users/czue/,https://2024.za.pycon.org/talks/30-using-coding-skills-to-make-passive-income/,29
31,"Modern web frontend development with Python, HTMX and friends","Once upon a time, if you wanted to build a modern web experience using a Python based web framework, an obvious choice was to expose a bunch of APIs and build your frontend in something else entirely (eg React).
Times have changed.
Tools like HTMX and AlpineJS have made HTML great again.
These tools make full stack web dev fast and fun, they simplify development, shrink code bases, and give backend devs the ability to do modern frontend work. In my personal experience I've seen the adoption of these tools lead to massive productivity gains for junior and senior devs alike.
This workshop will walk you through the process of building and testing a CRUD application with a rich and modern frontend.
As we build this out, you will implement a few patterns for handling some of web development’s most common frontend requirements. For example, hydration.
We'll be making use of:
Django
HTMX
a sprinkle of AlpineJS
a touch of of Tailwindcss
Playwright for testing
Even though this is a Django-based tutorial, we wont be covering any super advanced Django functionality. Our focus will be on the frontend, and testing the frontend.
If you would like to see what these tools are about, here are a few talks:
