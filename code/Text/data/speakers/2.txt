Bio Part 4: Hey there, I'm Nunudzai, but most folks call me Nunu.
Bio Part 5: I'm all about diving into the latest tech that amps up device security. Picture me as your go-to Cybersecurity Analyst, teaming up with all kinds of cool folks to keep things safe and sound.
Bio Part 6: In my past gig, I kicked things off as the Founding IT Security Engineer and Trainer at Twenty8 Labs over in Malaysia. These days, you can find me flexing my cybersecurity muscles at the Pumpkin Hotel in Zimbabwe. Oh, and on the side, I'm also known to rock the mic as a cybersecurity speaker, trainer, and educator.
Bio Part 7: Teaching and learning are my jam.
Bio Part 8: I firmly believe there's no such thing as an uncrackable system. That's why, as a cybersec pro, I'm always hunting for vulnerabilities and figuring out how to squash 'em. I thrive on sharing what I know and soaking up knowledge from all corners, especially if it's something new outside my usual turf.
