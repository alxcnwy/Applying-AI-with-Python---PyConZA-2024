Abstract:
Once upon a time, if you wanted to build a modern web experience using a Python based web framework, an obvious choice was to expose a bunch of APIs and build your frontend in something else entirely (eg React).
Times have changed.
Tools like HTMX and AlpineJS have made HTML great again.
These tools make full stack web dev fast and fun, they simplify development, shrink code bases, and give backend devs the ability to do modern frontend work. In my personal experience I've seen the adoption of these tools lead to massive productivity gains for junior and senior devs alike.
This workshop will walk you through the process of building and testing a CRUD application with a rich and modern frontend.
As we build this out, you will implement a few patterns for handling some of web developmentâ€™s most common frontend requirements. For example, hydration.
We'll be making use of:
Django
HTMX
a sprinkle of AlpineJS
a touch of of Tailwindcss
Playwright for testing
Even though this is a Django-based tutorial, we wont be covering any super advanced Django functionality. Our focus will be on the frontend, and testing the frontend.
If you would like to see what these tools are about, here are a few talks:
