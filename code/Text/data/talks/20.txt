Abstract:
Coding & robotics is the new subject in the DBE curriculum...
and the 4IR is robot powered...
So the robots are coming!
But what, how, where?
:David shares how CoderLevelUp.org are helping create a creative learning ecosystem for physical computing & robotics, from low floors to high ceilings with very wide walls.
Low floor: simulators & education bots (block based & Python) for pico and 2 wheeled robots from Microsoft Research, 
 - with ramps: code clubs, training & community
High ceilings: open source robots hosted at science institutes, being made in collab with local makers for research and development
 - with long ladders: sims, tutorials, challenges and hosted bots
Wide walls: robots underwater, planetary Roving, in space, and even flying airships
Let's see how we can liberate robots for all!
