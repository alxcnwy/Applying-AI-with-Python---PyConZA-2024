Abstract:
Machine learning offers a modern replacement for
human-curated predictive decisioning
. However, in practice,
predictive rules
manually created from
expert domain knowledge
remain extremely relevant in many industries, most notably
finance
. These rules are straightforward, highly explainable, and enable experts to incorporate valuable domain knowledge. However, the
open-source ecosystem
until recently, lacked comprehensive tooling for creating
decision flows
that can be
operationalized
following modern-day
machine learning
best practices.
In this talk, we will introduce a new
open-source decisioning framework
built on
Hamilton
, a versatile framework designed to streamline the creation and management of
dataflows
using standard Python functions. Hamilton simplifies the development process by converting functions into nodes in a
Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
, allowing for efficient execution and
visualization
of decision flows. Our new open-sourced framework enables scientists to create rules around
Statistical
,
Machine Learning
, and
Large-language models
. We will showcase the framework's ability to address
fraud detection
,
credit granting
, and integration with
LLMs
. This session is tailored for
decision creators
(e.g.,
data scientists
,
decision scientists
, and
data analysts
), and
operations engineers
.
The talk will delve into the key components of our Python-based decisioning solution applicable to finance, including
decision trees
,
credit risk scorecards
, and
decision tables
. We will emphasize using
Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)
to achieve
interoperability
,
traceability
, and
visual insights
into decision-making processes. We will then show how these decisioning processes can be
productionised
for
real-time
and
batch
use cases. The talk will provide listeners with practical insights for developing decisioning flows using best practices.
