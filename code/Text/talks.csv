Harnessing the Power of Community: Lessons from Speedrunning for the Python Ecosystem and Beyond,Nunudzai Mrewa,Other,Talk,Righthand Room,Oct 04 (Fri): 10:15,0:45,"Speedrunning, the art of completing video games as quickly as possible, has evolved into a vibrant community that exemplifies the power of community-driven innovation and collaboration. This talk delves into the fascinating world of speedrunners, highlighting how their collective efforts uncover hidden game mechanics and vulnerabilities that often elude traditional testing methods. By openly sharing knowledge and tools, speedrunners have not only broken records but also provided invaluable insights for game developers in areas such as testing, QA, and game balance.
The talk will explore the transferable skills and approaches of the speedrunning community, demonstrating how these principles can be applied to other industries. l will discuss how the collaborative spirit, open sharing of knowledge, and innovative problem-solving techniques can drive advancements specifically in software development  and cybersecurity, and beyond. By understanding the methodologies and mindset of speedrunners, attendees will gain practical insights into fostering innovation and achieving greater outcomes through community and collaboration."
It’s About Time: Time-Series Forecasting with Darts,Brenden Taylor,Data Science,Talk,Lefthand Room / Main Hall,Oct 03 (Thu): 10:25,0:45,"Along with the rise of “AI”, data-driven decision-making in businesses and organisations is also making a ‘buzz phrase’ of itself. And for most organisations, time series forecasting is a crucial component of making informed decisions. This talk will cover
Darts
, a relatively new Python library aimed at making time series analysis and forecasting more accessible while still including a range of models, from classical statistical methods to newer deep learning techniques, all without needing to import many other Python libraries.
In this talk, we will explore the tools
Darts
offers across the whole time series forecasting pipeline: preprocessing and anomaly detection, modelling (including ensembling), and performance evaluation and backtesting. We will start with an overview of the basic classes and components of
Darts
, followed by a demonstration of how to implement a basic ensemble model and visualise forecast results.
Additionally, we will also discuss some key features of Darts that sets it apart from more traditional time series libraries. In particular, the ‘Pythonic’ structuring of its models to use the
fit()
and
predict()
methods we’ve all come to know and love, similar to the popular Python
scikit-learn
library. We will also discuss some other advantages, such as the ease of including static past and future covariates, and encoders, as well as its integration with other popular Python libraries like
pandas
. As it’s a relatively new library, we will also discuss some of its current shortcomings.
Whether you’re a data scientist, analyst or simply interested in time series forecasting in Python (who isn’t?!), this talk will provide you with a solid foundational understanding of
Darts
so that you can apply it to your own work and projects.

Leveraging the NLTK library for Translation: A Case Study of Dyula-French Translation,Alta Saunders,Data Science,Talk,Lefthand Room / Main Hall,Oct 03 (Thu): 11:30,0:45,"In the field of natural language processing (NLP), transformer models and the Transformers library have started to become the go to for translation and other NLP tasks. However, resource requirements and data restrictions might not be favourable for transformer models and the use of other python libraries and resources should be considered. This talk will explore the potential of the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) python library in building an effective translation model, specifically for languages with limited training data.
In this talk we will look at an overview of  the NLTK library tools available for NLP tasks such as translation, emphasising their simplicity, efficiency, and accessibility relative to resource-intensive transformer counterparts.
To highlight how the NLTK library can be used for translation, we will look at a practical case study: translating Dyula to French, a scenario underscored by Dyula's status as an under-resourced language with limited translation data. Here, NLTK's tools will be leveraged to construct a Lexical model for translation, illustrating how NLTK mitigates challenges posed by limited datasets. By focussing on an under-resourced language, this talk will highlight how these limitations can be overcome by utilizing the tools provided within the NLTK library to create a translation model.
The talk will further highlight the benefits of using the NLTK library for translation by highlighting the advantages of the NLTK library such as ease of use, lower resource requirements and robustness with smaller datasets. To highlight the benefits a comparison will be made between the implementing a translation model using the popular Transformer library, looking at the memory usage, latency and translation performance.
The simplicity and ease of use of the NLTK library makes it an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced practitioners in NLP, with this talk highlighting the capabilities of this library for NLP tasks.
Below is a brief break down of the talk structure:
Overview of NLP and translation models.
